# Krazy Kanines
This is a simple project with the hope to provide people some much needed stress relief after a hectic day. This is aimed at everyone who wants to enjoy our funny furry friends. This will hopefully be helpful in creating a few minutes of relief from daily life.

This project is for educational purposes and can not be used as a template for a business to use. The main aim is to build a responsive website using HTML and CSS as part of the User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project for Code Institute. I will also use the Bootstrap framework to keep the website consistent and clear.
